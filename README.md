# Sample APIs 2.0

Sample APIs has been given a major overhaul. Due to the fact Vercel.com has changed the way their servers work, we have had to rethink how the system was built. Over all, the changes are for the better. Contribution has now become much more easier than ever.

## Purpose

Understanding RESTful APIs is hard enough, even without including an authentication mechanism. The sole purpose of this repository is to play with RESTful endpoints and learn. We have a few endpoints that you can start playing around with right away! If you are not finding anything you are interested in, create your own endpoints and/or submit a pull request. Take a look at the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/jermbo/SampleAPIs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get involved.

## Changes

Hosting has switched again due to `Vercel.com`'s static nature. The app is being self hosted and is back to being fully CRUD-able.
